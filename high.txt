I would really prefer to travel on my own with plenty on time, but who wouldnâ€™t? Unfor- tunately that is not always possible. It is always nicer to walk looking around at the same time, steping by little shops and cafes, talking to people, asking for directions, going to the places you choose to go to and discovering everything on your own. I think that is the travel ideal for many of us, but we usually have a hard time on finding the time to do it that way, and instead make plans with too many destinations all at once in a small schedule.
